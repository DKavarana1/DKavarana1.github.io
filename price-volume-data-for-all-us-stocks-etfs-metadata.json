Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. It\u0027s one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain. \n\n### Content\n\nThe data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt. Note that prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset belongs to me. I\u2019m sharing it here for free. You may do with it as you wish. \n\n### Inspiration\n\nMany have tried, but most have failed, to predict the stock market\u0027s ups and downs. Can you do any better? "}
